<p>
    This bicycle is Lessons. I thought of the name the thirteenth time or so I walked into my kitchen, sighed deeply then optimistically said "Well i learned another valuable lesson..." Perhaps one of the biggest lessons building this bicycle has thought me is gratituted in my opportunity to pursue this crazy dream. I have fallen so in love with this process that each misstep along the way didn't lead to frustration, but a legitimate lesson of what not to do. For the first time in a heap of years, I'm creating something that i can hold, and understand and be proud of.
