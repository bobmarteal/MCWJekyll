<h2>
  Design brief
</h2>
<p>
  This bicycle is Lessons. I thought of the name the thirteenth time or so I walked into my kitchen, sighed deeply then optimistically said "Well i learned another valuable lesson..." Perhaps one of the biggest lessons building this bicycle has thought me is gratituted in my opportunity to pursue this crazy dream. I have fallen so in love with this process that each misstep along the way didn't lead to frustration, but a legitimate lesson of what not to do. For the first time in a heap of years, I'm creating something that i can hold, and understand and be proud of.

  The design brief for Lessons was for an all-road bicycle, that can handle a daily commute in rain-soaked upstate New York and spend hours on gravel roads with comfort and style. The bicycle can be mounted with a rear rack for paniers, and full-length fenders. Tire clearance is a robust 700x52. Flat-mount brakes and and thru-axels embrace current standars and provide safe, powerful braking and a stiff feel.

  Build out details
</h2>
<p>
  The Columbus Futura Cross, carbon fork keeps the front end light and stable. The 1x SRAM Rival drivetrain and groupset perfectly match the riding goals for the bicycle. The Hunt 4-season disc wheels shod with 700x42 Teravail Ramparts are set up tubless and are fast and supple. Up front the 46mm Salsa Cowchipper provides comfort and stability in all terrain.
