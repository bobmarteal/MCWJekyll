        Marteal Cycle Works (MCW) is grounded in the belief that everyone deserves to experience joy, adventure, and wonder on a
        bike. Every cyclist, whether an avid racer, an occasional tourer, or a total beginner deserves to be valued and respected as a person, a cyclist and a customer.
    </p>

        MCW was founded by me, Bob Marteal, after years of cycling and shopping the market looking for good customer service and
        a bicycle that felt right. I often felt frustrated and that there was no place for me in the market. In 2014 after hours of research I purchased what i thought would be my forever-bike. Shortly after I began to feel it wasn’t quite right, and didn’t feel I had anywhere to turn.

        <h2>Why Custom?</h2>
        <p>
            Bicycles available in stores are designed and built for riders of average height, weight, and length. For a lot of cyclists, this leads to compromise. If you have never had a bicycle that never quite fit or didn't do what you need, a custom bicycle fit to your measurements and uses can be a dream come true.

            The design brief for Lessons was for an all-road bicycle, that can handle a daily commute in rain-soaked upstate New York and spend hours on gravel roads with comfort and style.
