	<p>
		Marteal Cycle Works (MCW) is grounded in the belief that everyone deserves
		to experience joy, adventure, and wonder on a bike. Every cyclist, whether
		an avid racer, an occasional tourer, or a total beginner deserves to be
		valued and respected as a person, a cyclist and a customer.
	</p>
	<p>
		MCW was founded by me, Bob Marteal, after years of cycling and shopping the
		market looking for good customer service and a bicycle that felt right. I
		often felt frustrated that there was no place for me in the market. In 2014
		after hours of research, I purchased what I thought would be my
		forever-bike. Shortly after, I began to feel it wasn’t quite right and
		didn’t feel I had anywhere to turn.

			This is the Civic. It was built for my son, who does in-fact, have a wild
			infatuation with the Honda Civic. This bicycle represents the first frame
			built by me, without the watchful eye of a master frame builder and
			teacher. I thought my first bike Lessons was aptly named, but being able
			to “create your own learning opportunities” is a different experience in
			the humbling nature of bicycle frame building.

		<h2>Why a Custom Bicycle?</h2>
		<p>
			Bicycles available in stores are designed and built for riders of average
			height, weight, and length. For most cyclists, this leads to compromise.
			If you have ever had a bicycle that didn't quite fit or do what you need,
			a custom bicycle fit to your measurements and uses can be a dream come
			true.

			I wanted to breathe new life into my old Surly Crosscheck with a fresh
			coat of paint. The bicycle is a utilitarian get around towner so nothing
			flashy was needed. I decided to go with a two-toned black and gray scheme
			to add some depth and interest. I slightly modified the Surly logos for
			masking and painting.
