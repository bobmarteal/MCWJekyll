<h2>
    An Individual fit
</h2>
<p>
    A custom bicycle removes the sacrifices most of you are accustomed to making when you shop commercially produced bicycles. An off-the-rack bicycle is made for a range of bicyclists. These predefined models do not not take into account your torso, leg or arm length. They can’t match your flexibility, or riding style. Inevitably, achieving a
    suitable fit relies on fiddling around with components to approximate a custom frame.
</p>
<p>
    A custom fit and geometry will make you realize all the rough edges you have endured. Pains will lessen, you’ll be faster, you’ll be able to ride longer to enjoy the world over the next hill and around the next corner. A custom fit bicycle feels like a natural extension of your body.

<h2>
    An Individual design
</h2>
<p>
    A bespoke bicycle is more than an individual fit. A custom frame will have tubes selected to your individual riding styles and needs. A custom framebuilder will consider if you are a powerful rider in the legs, do you have any injuries,do you like to work from the saddle or do you dance on the pedals, what weight-class are you in or do you plan to ride for hours day after day or short and fast commutes?
</p>
<p>
    The tubes and geometry of a custom frame will take these and more questions in to consideration, to select the ideal set of tubes, and other frame components.
</p>
<p>
    A bicycle is a personal vehicle. When you sit atop your custom bicycle you will have a unique sense of ownership, a sense of pride.
