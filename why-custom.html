   A custom fit bicycle removes the sacrifices you make when shopping commercially produced bicycles. Off-the-rack bicycles are sized for a range of bicyclists, generally based on rider height. These predetermined sizes do not not take into account variations in your torso, leg or arm length. These bicycle assume all riders that are 5'-11" have the same arm and leg lengths. They can’t match your flexibility, or riding style. Inevitably, achieving a suitable fit relies on fiddling around with components to approximate a custom frame.

<p>
    A custom fit and geometry will make you realize all the rough edges you have endured. Pains will diminish, you’ll be faster, you’ll be able to ride longer to enjoy the world over the next hill and around the next corner. A custom fit bicycle feels like a natural extension of your body.

<p>
    A bespoke bicycle is more than an individual fit. A custom frame is built with tubes selected to match and enhance your individual riding styles and needs. As a custom framebuilder, I will consider if you are a powerful rider in the legs, do you have any injuries, do you like to work from the saddle or do you dance on the pedals, what weight-class are you in or do you plan to ride for hours day after day or short and fast commutes?
</p>
<p>
    The tubes and geometry of a custom frame will take these and more questions in to consideration, to select the ideal set of tubes, and other frame components.
</p>
<p>
    A bicycle is a personal vehicle. When you sit atop your custom bicycle you will have a unique sense of ownership, a sense of pride. You will know this is your one true bicycle.
