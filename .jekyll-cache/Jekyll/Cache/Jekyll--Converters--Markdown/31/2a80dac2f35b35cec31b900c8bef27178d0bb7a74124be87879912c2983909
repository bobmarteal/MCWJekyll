  This bicycle is Lessons. I thought of the name the thirteenth time or so I walked into my kitchen, sighed deeply then optimistically said "Well i learned another valuable lesson..." Perhaps one of the biggest lessons building this bicycle has thought me is gratituted in my opportunity to pursue this crazy dream. I have fallen so in love with this process that each misstep along the way didn't lead to frustration, but a legitimate lesson of what not to do. For the first time in a heap of years, I'm creating something that i can hold, and understand and be proud of.

  The design brief for Lessons was for an all-road bicycle, that can handle a daily commute in rain-soaked upstate New York and spend hours on gravel roads with comfort and style. The bicycle can be mounted with a rear rack for paniers, and full-length fenders. Tire clearance is a robust 700x52. Flat-mount brakes and and thru-axels embrace current standars and provide safe, powerful braking and a stiff feel.

  The Columbus Futura Cross, carbon fork keeps the front end light and stable. The 1x SRAM Rival drivetrain and groupset perfectly match the riding goals for the bicycle. The Hunt 4-season disc wheels shod with 700x42 Teravail Ramparts are set up tubless and are fast and supple. Up front the 46mm Salsa Cowchipper provides comfort and stability in all terrain.
