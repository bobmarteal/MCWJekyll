<p>
    Marteal Cycleworks is founded on the belief that everyone deserves to experience joy, adventure, and wonder on a bike,
    and that every cyclist, whether an avid racer, an occasional tourer, or a total beginner deserves to be valued and
    respected as a person, a cyclist and a customer.
</p>
<p>
    I have been an active cyclist since saving lawn-mowing money and buying my first bicycle in 1990. As years and bicycles
    went by, I always had a feeling that my lack of racing, or long-distance touring or mechanic level understanding of how
    bicycles worked was a barrier to me connecting with bicycling resources available to me.

<h2>
    Not a forever bike
</h2>
<p>
    In 2014 after hours of research I purchased what he thought would be my forever-bike, but i never had the shop or
    individual that i could really reach out to and feel safe in asking the questions that really need to be asked to find
    the right bike. Shortly after I was sure that, in-fact, i had not gotten the right bicycle, and I didnâ€™t feel I had
    anywhere to turn.    
</p>
<p>
    My bicycle did not fit and lead to knee injuries, wrist pain, back pain, and discomfort. The poor fit made me feel less
    safe and secure, leading to hesitation in less stable conditions (gravel and wet pavement). I was not experiencing joy
    and was limited in my exploration of the world around me. A poorly matched bicycle was keeping my cycling ambitions on a
    short leash.

<h2>
    Bespoke?    
</h2>
<p>
    As a bicycle commuter and weekend warrior, bicycle riding was not my life or identity, but it was an important part of
    it. I knew there was potential to be even more integral if I could just find the right bike.    
</p>
<p>
    After years of cycling on ill-fitting bikes and trying to find a solution to mine I came across the world of the bespoke
    bicycle.    
</p>
<blockquote>
    Bespoke: made for a particular customer or user    
</blockquote>
<p>
    The idea that craftspeople would measure an individual rider, design a bicycle and build it by hand was staggering. The
    confluence of craft and design nestled its way into my thoughts and soon i was devouring everything available to me
    online to learn about this new possibility.    
</p>
<h2>
    Ah, ha    
</h2>
<p>
    The decision to pursue this dream happened one cold winter day while tapping a hole into a sheared bolt on my bicycle. I
    felt the teeth of the bit bite into the steel and knew immediately, without any doubt, manipulating and creating with
    this material was the thing I was called to do. With the tremendous support of my family I enrolled in a 7-day bicycle
    frame building class at the Bicycle Academy in Frome England and set out a rather simple mission:

        wonder while exploring the world wherever they may go.
